# Random Forest Classifier Example

This folder contains a Python implementation of a **Random Forest Classifier**, a widely-used machine learning algorithm for classification tasks. The code is located in the `random_forest_classifier.py` file.

## About Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the majority class as the prediction. It is effective for both classification and regression tasks and provides a natural way to evaluate the importance of input features.

### Key Features:
- Ensemble Learning
- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- Handles high-dimensional data well
- Provides feature importance

### Files:
- `random_forest_classifier.py`: Contains the implementation of the Random Forest Classifier using the Iris dataset as an example.
- `README.md`: This file, providing documentation for the code.

### How to Run:
To run the example, execute the `random_forest_classifier.py` script:

```bash
python random_forest_classifier.py
